                  Futsal is the official version of the indoor football (soccer) played under the regulations of FIFA. According to Wikipedia.org, futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller, harder, low-bounce ball. The surface, ball and rules together favour ball control and passing in small spaces. The game's "emphasis is on improvisation, creativity and technique".
                  <br>
                  The name „futsal“ originates from Spanish terms "fútbol sala" or "fútbol de salón" and Portuguese term futebol de salão which can be translated as „indoor football“ or „hall football“.
